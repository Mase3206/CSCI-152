# CSCI-152

Here lies the code and notes for my Java programming class! You are welcome to read, use, modify, and distribute this code, as long as you follow the restrictions of the license. For the non-laywers out there (or for those who just don't have that much time), see [this explanation and breakdown of the GNU v3 license](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-gpl-3) on TL;DR Legal.

## General Structure

- All modules have a subfolder within the `modules` folder. Each module subfolder will contain the source code for all assignments assigned within that module, as well as all in-class practice code and notes. All notes are in [CommonMark-conformant Markdown](https://commonmark.org).
- All practice code and notes for quizzes, tests, and exams are located in named subfolders under their respective folders. All notes are in CommonMark-conformant Markdown.

## Things to note

- This is not an open source software project. It is simply somewhere to put my code where I can access it from any of my computers.
- While public, this repo is read-only to anyone but me. So... don't make a pull request.
